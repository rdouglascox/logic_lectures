<ul class="incremental">
<li>in the previous lecture, we introduced the idea of logical form, the
logical form of a proposition</li>
<li>in this lecture we take a closer look at the logical forms of
propositions</li>
<li>we look at the logical form of propositions constructed using the
<strong>truth functional connectives</strong> negation, conjunction,
disjunction, conditional, and biconditional</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="slide section level2">
<h1>learning outcomes</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>after doing the relevant reading for this lecture, listening to the
lecture, and attending the relevant tutorial, you will be able to:
<ul class="incremental">
<li>identify different sorts of compound propositions and identify their
components
<ul class="incremental">
<li>negations, and the negand of a negation</li>
<li>conjunctions, and the conjuncts of a conjunction</li>
<li>disjunctions, and the disjuncts of a disjunction</li>
<li>conditionals, and the antecedent and consequent of a
conditional</li>
<li>biconditionals, and the right-hand-side and the left-hand-side of a
conditional</li>
</ul></li>
<li>explain the difference between basic and compound propositions</li>
<li>explain what makes a connective a truth-functional connective</li>

<li>some propositions are made up of other propositions

<h1>connectives and compound propositions</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>compound propositions are made up of other propositions and bits
that connect these other propositions together to make a compound
proposition</li>
<li>these ‘bits’ are called connectives</li>
<li>a <strong>connective</strong> ‘connects’ propositions to make
propositions
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Jane lives in Australia <strong>and</strong> Jack lives in
China</li>

<div class="slide section level2">

<ul class="incremental">
<li>in each of these examples we can see how a larger proposition is
built out of other propositions by way of the connectives ‘and’, ‘or’,
‘if, then’, and ‘not’</li>
<li>‘not’ may seem odd. ‘not’ doesn’t ‘connect’ propositions. still, it
takes one proposition and makes another. so we call it a
connective.</li>

<div id="truth-functional-connectives" class="slide section level2">
<h1>truth-functional connectives</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>some connectives are special in the following sense: when they
are used to make a compound proposition from other propositions, we can
be sure that the <strong>truth</strong> of the compound expression is
determined by the truth or falsity of the propositions it is made out
of</p></li>
<li><p>a connective is <strong>truth-functional connective</strong> if
and only if the truth or falsity of a compound proposition formed from
the connective and some other propositions is completely determined by
the truth and falsity of those component propositions</p></li>

<h1>truth-functional connectives and propositional logic</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>the truth-functional connectives are at the heart of
<strong>propositional logic</strong></li>
<li>we might say that propositional logic is the systematic study of the
laws of truth with respect to the form propositions have as a
consequence of their being built using truth-functional connectives</li>
<li>since the propositions studied in other areas of logic are built
using truth-functional connectives, propositional logic forms the basis
of the logics studied in these other areas</li>
<li>the formal language <strong>PL</strong> is designed to assist us in
the systematic study of these laws of truth</li>
